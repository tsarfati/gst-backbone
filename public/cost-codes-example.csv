USAGE NOTES:
=============
Dynamic Group Structure:
- Level 1 (e.g., "1"): Dynamic cost code GROUP - parents all codes starting with that number
- Level 2 (e.g., "1.09"): Dynamic cost code PARENT - accumulates costs from child codes
- Level 3 (e.g., "1.09.01"): Regular cost code CHILD - where actual costs are recorded

Budget Flow:
1. Create dynamic budget for group "1" with total labor budget (e.g., $500,000)
2. Create dynamic budget for parent "1.09" with general labor budget (e.g., $200,000)
3. As invoices are coded to "1.09.01", "1.09.02", etc., costs automatically roll up to "1.09"
4. All costs from "1.09", "1.10", etc. roll up to group "1"

Chart of Accounts Integration:
- Each cost code links to a chart of accounts number
- This enables financial reporting and general ledger integration
- Groups use summary accounts (e.g., 5000)
- Parents use department accounts (e.g., 5010)
- Children use detailed accounts (e.g., 5011, 5012)

Import Instructions:
1. First import dynamic groups (is_dynamic_group = true)
2. Then import dynamic parents (middle level codes)
3. Finally import child codes
4. The trigger will automatically set parent relationships based on code patterns
